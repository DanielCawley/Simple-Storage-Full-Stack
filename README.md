# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It is for me to practise using react, hardhat and solidity in a full stack project. I know its basic but you got to start somewhere!

To run it: 
clone the repo
open a hardhat local host with ```npx hardhat node```
deploy the contract with ```npx hardhat run scripts\deploy.js --network localhost```
input the address of the contract in the shell/cli into the variable ```simpleStorageAddress``` in App.js
fire up the localhost with ```npm start```!
